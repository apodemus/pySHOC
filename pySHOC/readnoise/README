The files named 'SHOC1.txt' and 'SHOC2.txt' provide the manufacturer measurements of
 the readnoise, base level (bias) and sensitivity for each available camera
 setting of readout speed, ADC bit-depth, pre-amplifier gain, and output
 amplifier mode

    Which output amplifier is being used: Electron Multiplying or CONvensional
PreAmp:
    gain (ADU / e)
Sensitivity:
